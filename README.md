# Twitter-Reply-Bot

A simple Python Twitter Reply Bot which was made using Tweepy.
This bot will search for tweets that mention our bot account. Our bot will reply to the mention tweet with a random phrase. 
The random phrases depend on which theme you want for the bot, for this reason the file is not in the repository. The idea is that this project will serve as a basis for other bots to easily use the response to a tweet. 

You will need a Twitter Developer Account, you can sign up for one here - https://developer.twitter.com/en

This Repository was made for a tutorial video, which you can watch here - https://youtu.be/IAsI7eDEh2Y
